    "# 🧠 Dataset Condensation via Distribution Matching (PyTorch Implementation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📘 Primer\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements **Dataset Condensation using Distribution Matching (DM)** — a data-efficient learning approach that synthesizes a *compact yet representative* set of samples capable of training models nearly as well as the full dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 What is Dataset Condensation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset Condensation aims to **compress a large dataset into a much smaller synthetic set** that preserves the original data’s learning signal.  \n",
    "Instead of storing millions of real examples, we learn a small synthetic dataset `x_syn, y_syn` such that models trained on it achieve similar generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation, we use **Distribution Matching (DM)** — a technique that aligns feature distributions between real and synthetic data in the output space of a neural network.  \n",
    "At each iteration, synthetic data are updated to minimize the discrepancy between the mean activations of real and synthetic examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Workflow Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup & Reproducibility**\n",
    "   - Import required libraries.\n",
    "   - Define deterministic seeds for Python, NumPy, and PyTorch.\n",
    "   - Set key experiment hyperparameters (`ipc`, `eval_net_type`, `optim`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Loading**\n",
    "   - Load and preprocess the time-series dataset (train/val/test splits).\n",
    "   - Infer model input dimensions from a single training batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Synthetic Data Initialization**\n",
    "   - Initialize `x_syn` and `y_syn` either from random noise (`init='rand'`) or sampled real examples (`init='real'`).\n",
    "   - Attach gradients to `x_syn` so it can be optimized directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Baseline Evaluation**\n",
    "   - Train a baseline model (LSTM/RNN) on the initial synthetic data.\n",
    "   - Compute validation and test performance (AUC/APR) before condensation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Distribution Matching Loop**\n",
    "   - For each iteration:\n",
    "     - Randomly sample real data from each class.\n",
    "     - Pass real and synthetic data through a frozen random network.\n",
    "     - Compute **DM loss** = squared distance between mean feature activations.\n",
    "     - Backpropagate through synthetic data and update `x_syn` via SGD.\n",
    "   - Periodically evaluate on validation data and save the best synthetic set.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Final Evaluation**\n",
    "   - Load the best condensed dataset (`x_syn`, `y_syn`).\n",
    "   - Train a fresh model from scratch on this condensed dataset.\n",
    "   - Evaluate on validation and test sets to measure performance retention.\n",

    "## 🎯 Exercises — Explore and Compare\n",
    "\n",
    "Use these guided experiments to deepen your understanding of **Distribution Matching for Dataset Condensation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vary the number of instances per class (`ipc`)**\n",
    "   - Change `ipc` in the setup cell (e.g. `ipc = 500`, `200`, `50`, `10`).\n",
    "   - Re-run the experiment and note:\n",
    "     - How does validation/test **AUC** change as `ipc` decreases?\n",
    "     - How does training time scale with smaller synthetic datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Change the initialization strategy**\n",
    "   - Switch between  \n",
    "     - `init = 'rand'` → purely random noise,  \n",
    "     - `init = 'real'` → sampled from true data.\n",
    "   - Observe how the **convergence speed** and **final synthetic quality** differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compare models trained on real vs. synthetic data**\n",
    "   - From **Exercise 1**, you already trained a baseline model on the **real dataset**.\n",
    "   - Now, compare its test performance with the model trained here on **synthetic data**.\n",
    "   - Discuss:\n",
    "     - How close does the synthetic dataset come to the real dataset’s performance?\n",
    "     - Which metrics (AUROC, AUPRC) show the largest gap?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Change evaluation architecture**\n",
    "   - Try `eval_net_type = 'rnn'` vs. `'lstm'` (or even a CNN/MLP if applicable).\n",
    "   - Does a more expressive model help capture patterns from condensed data?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Inspect learned synthetic samples**\n",
    "   - Visualize `x_syn` for each class (plot feature distributions or sample sequences).\n",
    "   - Do the synthetic examples resemble the original data’s temporal structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "🧭 **Goal:**  \n",
    "By the end of these exercises, you should understand:\n",
    "- How data condensation quality depends on `ipc` and initialization.  \n",
    "- The trade-off between dataset size and generalization.  \n",
    "- How well condensed data generalize across different model architectures.\n",
