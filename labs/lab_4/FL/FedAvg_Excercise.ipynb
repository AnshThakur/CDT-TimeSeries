    "## What is Federated Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Federated Learning (FL) is a **decentralized machine learning approach** where multiple clients (e.g., hospitals, mobile devices, or institutions) collaboratively train a shared global model **without sharing their raw data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of pooling all data in a central server, each client:\n",
    "1. **Trains locally** on its own private dataset.\n",
    "2. **Sends model updates (parameters or gradients)** — not the data — to a central server.\n",
    "3. The **server aggregates** these updates to improve the **global model**.\n",
    "4. This process repeats over several **communication rounds** until convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Why Federated Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional centralized ML requires moving all data to one place — often impractical or illegal due to **privacy**, **security**, or **data ownership** concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Federated Learning enables:\n",
    "- ✅ **Data privacy** — raw data never leaves the client.\n",
    "- ✅ **Scalability** — computation distributed across clients.\n",
    "- ✅ **Collaboration** — multiple institutions can contribute without sharing sensitive data.\n",

    "## 🏗️ Federated Learning Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**1️⃣ Initialization (Server)**\n",
    "- The server defines a **global model** (e.g., CNN, LSTM).\n",
    "- Sends the model weights to all clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2️⃣ Local Training (Clients)**\n",
    "- Each client trains the model on its **local dataset** for a few epochs.\n",
    "- The resulting **updated model weights** are sent back to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3️⃣ Aggregation (Server)**\n",
    "- The server combines all local updates (e.g., via **Federated Averaging — FedAvg**).\n",
    "- Produces a new **global model** that captures knowledge from all clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4️⃣ Iteration**\n",

    "| **IID** | Clients have data drawn from similar distributions | Each hospital has balanced patient demographics |\n",

    "In this notebook we **simulate** a federated learning (FL) experiment inside a single Python process.  \n",
    "This is an educational and reproducible setup that mimics the high-level behavior of a real FL system while keeping the code simple to run on a laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a description of what the code does and how the simulation maps to real FL components.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulation design (high level)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create clients (nodes)**  \n",
    "   We simulate `K` clients by partitioning the dataset into `K` disjoint subsets (one per client).  \n",
    "   Partitioning can be IID or non-IID — in this notebook we use a Dirichlet-based split to create **non-IID** client data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Server initialises a global model**  \n",
    "   A single global model (e.g., a CNN) lives on the server and is copied to each client at the start of every round.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Federated rounds (main loop)**  \n",
    "   For each round:\n",
    "   - The server **sends** the current global weights to all clients (in code: `local_model.load_state_dict(global_model.state_dict())`).\n",
    "   - Each client trains the model **locally** on its own data for a few epochs and returns its updated model object.\n",
    "     - In our simulation, local training is done **serially** in a loop (client 0, client 1, ... client K-1).\n",
    "     - In real FL, clients usually train in parallel and communicate asynchronously or in rounds.\n",
    "   - The server **aggregates** the returned local model parameters using **FedAvg** (weighted average, typically by client sample count).\n",
    "   - The aggregated parameters replace the server's global model for the next round.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Logging & saving**  \n",
    "   - We record per-client training losses and validation metrics after local updates.\n",
    "   - We evaluate the **global model** on each client’s test set and save the best global `state_dict()` when it improves.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final evaluation**  \n",
    "   - After training, we load and evaluate the saved **best local models** (if saved per-client) and the **final/global model** on every client’s test data to compare local vs global performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key implementation details (mapping to code cells)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data partitioning**: `split_data_non_iid(...)` (in `loaders_federated_learning.py`) uses a Dirichlet distribution to simulate heterogeneity across clients.  \n",
    "- **Client DataLoaders**: `get_loaders(...)` (in `loaders_federated_learning.py`) returns a list `Loaders` where `Loaders[k] = [train_loader, val_loader, test_loader]` for client `k`.  \n",
    "- **Local training**: `train_model(...)` (in `Client.py`) performs training for a client and returns the updated `local_model` and training loss.  \n",
    "- **Aggregation**: `federated_averaging(models, weights)` computes weighted average of client parameters; server updates global model via `global_model.load_state_dict(...)`.  \n",
    "- **Evaluation**: `evaluate_models(...)` and `evaluate_models_test(...)` compute AUC / APR per client; `prediction_binary(...)` runs final test predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why serial simulation is OK for simulation\n",
    "- **Deterministic & simple** — easy to debug and reproduce in a classroom or on a laptop.\n",
    "- **Focuses on algorithmic ideas** (FedAvg, non-IID effects, client heterogeneity) without the complexity of networking, concurrency, or device management.\n",
    "- **Easily extensible** to parallel/real FL frameworks later (e.g., Flower, TensorFlow Federated, PySyft).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations vs real FL systems (be aware)\n",
    "- **No network conditions**: We ignore latency, bandwidth, and dropped clients.\n",
    "- **No client asynchrony**: Clients are simulated serially; we don’t model stragglers or partial participation unless explicitly coded.\n",
    "- **Single process memory**: All model copies and data live in the same process and memory; not realistic for large-scale deployments.\n",
    "- **Privacy guarantees**: Simulation alone does not provide privacy (e.g., differential privacy or secure aggregation must be added explicitly)."
